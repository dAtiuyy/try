## Main Idea

## A level deeper

## Explaining
Ill keep it short and simple. The code is trash, Im trying and it wont work most likely but Ill try to document my adventure.

## Demo BABY!
1. Basic output:
<p align="center">
  <img src="boutput.jpg" />
</p>

2. decrypted output(i think):
<p align="center">
  <img src="rc4output.jpg" />
</p>

## Down the line
For this project i wont be going the same route as Swrlly, i wont make a separated GUI instead i will attach to the valor.exe process and write on top of that making an overlay.
