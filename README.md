## Explaining
Ill keep it short and simple. The code is trash, Im trying and it wont work most likely but Ill try to document my adventure.

## Demo BABY!
1. Basic output:
<p align="center">

</p>

2. decrypted output(i think):
<p align="center">
  <img src="rc4output.jpg" />
</p>

## TODO!!!
1. parse basic packets and ID them
2. there are plugins made by Swrlly and i intend to ID the packets i need to use such plugins
3. HOOKING!!! FISHING! we need ID them packets to hook em and go brr brr ok? trust me bro

## Down the line
For this project i wont be going the same route as Swrlly, i wont make a separated GUI instead i will attach to the valor.exe process and write on top of that making an overlay.
